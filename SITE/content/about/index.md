## High-dimensional Sharpened Dimensionality Reduction (HD-SDR)
High-dimensional Sharpened Dimensionality Reduction (HD-SDR) sharpens the original high-dimensional data before dimensionality reduction to create visually segregrated sample clusters, which is targeted for user-guided labeling.

### Setup
Code is written in C++ and is available [here](https://github.com/youngjookim/sdr).
```
https://github.com/youngjookim/sdr
```
\
To get the code running please include the following:\
a. [Nanoflann](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann) header file\
b. [Eigen 3.3.3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)\
c. [Tapkee dimension reduction library](http://tapkee.lisitsyn.me/)

The sharpening filter is implemented in function 'sharpening_for_dr()' in main.cpp.

Input files should be located in the 'Data' folder and consist of one header file and one data file for each data set. Please run 'example_data_set_1'.

### Experimental results
