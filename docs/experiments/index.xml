      <description>Comparison of DR and HD-SDR on HAR data with dimensions pre-selected using PCA as in Figure 12. Note that the separation of clusters is slightly improved for HD-SDR as compared with DR (although subclusters are visually less separable). We note that nearly all samples in cluster (1) are from the lying movement, cluster (2) mostly includes samples from static postures (standing and sitting), and cluster (3) mostly includes samples from the three dynamic activities.</description>

      <description>Comparison of neighborhood hit (Qh) for sharpened data and original data of the five different types of synthetic data used in Figure 3. For all synthetic data sets, Qh is always higher for the sharpened data as compared with the original data. We also note that Qh for sharpened data is higher when clusters are more separated (α=0.04 compared with α=0.01).</description>

      <title>DR vs. SDR with real-world astronomical data</title>

      <description>We compare DR and HD-SDR (RP, LMDS, t-SNE, and UMAP) for an unlabeled astronomical data set with no ground-truth labels: GALAH DR2 (n=10K with d=10). The projections are color-coded by one of the input values, [Fe/H], so that astronomers can further analyze the data. Note that in all cases, HD-SDR shows a clearer separation of clusters compared with DR, and SLMDS, St-SNE, and SUMAP exhibit four major clusters with similar distributions of colors within each cluster, while SRP shows three major clusters with one of them having subclusters.</description>

      <description>Comparison of neighborhood hit (Qh) for DR and HD-SDR of the five different types of synthetic data used for Figure 3. Note that St-SNE, t-SNE, and SLMDS yield high Qh values near one for (a)&amp;ndash;(c) and (e), which suggests that the corresponding labels of the k-size neighborhoods are well-preserved for HD-SDR. However, HD-SDR for sub-clustered data produces lower Qh compared with DR, as shown in (d), and this can be seen visually in Figure 3(a)&amp;ndash;(d).</description>

      <description>The neighborhood hit (Qh) metric for DR and HD-SDR using labeled real-world data sets with different values of k. We note that Qh is lower for St-SNE than for t-SNE for most values of k in (b)-(d). However for LMDS, which produces a weaker separation of clusters than t-SNE, SLMDS produces a higher value of Qh compared with LMDS for all data sets.</description>

      <description>(a) SLMDS projection of the GALAH DR2 sample, where clusters are visually labeled by one of us (SCT). The labeled clusters in SLMDS help domain experts to further analyze the data as follows: (b) Tinsley diagram for the GALAH DR2 sample, showing the abundance of magnesium as a function of the iron abundance, used to interpret the origin and location of Milky Way stars. This diagram suggests to our domain-expert (SCT) that stars in Class 1 belong to the Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s thin disk&#39;&#39;, while those in Classes 2 and 4 appear to belong to the Milky Way&#39;s metal-rich thick disk&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; and metal-poor thick disk&#39;&#39;, respectively, and stars in Class 3 appear to belong to the Milky Way&#39;s stellar halo&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>(a) Wall-clock timing of LGC, for different number of observations along the x-axis and varying dimensions up to 20D. (b) Wall-clock time measurement of LGC on 10K (20D) data also used in (a), using different learning rates α. We note that the wall-clock time increases with increasing α and depends heavily on the number of dimensions.</description>

      <title>Results of four neighborhood-based quality metrics for Banknote data</title>

      <description>Results of four neighborhood-based quality metrics for Banknote data: Neighborhood hit (Qh), Trustworthiness (Qt), Continuity (Qc), and Jaccard set distance (Qj). Note that Qhis consistent with results from Figure 3 and best represents the visual cluster separation, whereas Qt, Qc, and Qjsuggest the opposite. Note that Qt, Qc, and Qjdo not consider class label information. More results including Qt, Qc, and Qjfor the five synthetic data sets can be found in the supplemental materials.</description>

      <description>Comparison of DR and HD-SDR using four different real-world data. DR methods are ordered from left to right based on how well clusters are separated. The samples are colored by their ground-truth labels for visual examination purposes. Note that the sharpening method significantly enhances the visual separability of clusters for the first three data sets, except for SUMAP as shown in the sixth column. Additionally, St-SNE and SUMAP exhibit more oversegmentation of clusters than SRP and SLMDS.</description>

      <description>Comparison of DR and HD-SDR using five different types of synthetic data. DR methods are ordered from left to right based on how well clusters are separated. The samples are colored by the ground-truth labels of five different clusters for visual examination purposes. The results for SRP and SLMDS have been obtained with α and for St-SNE (perplexity=50) and SUMAP with α=0.01. Note that our sharpening method enhances the separation of clusters for DR methods with less ability to separate clusters (i.</description>

      <title>Effect of different hyperparameters using non-Gaussian synthetic data - Lognormal</title>
      <link>https://youngjookim.github.io/sdr/experiments/2/</link>

      <description>Effects of different parameters using 2D non-Gaussian (log-normal, μ=0, and σ=1) data with 10K observations. Note that the effects of the parameters are similar to those of Figure 1. However, LGC with too large values of T and α is prone to outliers (long tails), as shown in (d) and (l), but this problem can be solved by setting a larger value of k.</description>

      <description>Effects of parameters used in LGC. 2D Gaussian data with 10K observations and three clusters (a) are used to show the effects of the number of iterations (T) as shown in (a)&amp;ndash;(d), number of nearest neighbors (k) in (e)&amp;ndash;(l), and learning rate (α) in (m)&amp;ndash;(p). Points are color-coded based on their ground-truth labels. The cluster borders become fuzzy when using a too high T, as shown in (d). k and α both contribute to the degree of segmentation of the clusters; without choosing an appropriate α, k may not significantly affect the segmentation, as shown in rows (e)&amp;ndash;(h) and (i)&amp;ndash;(l).</description>
